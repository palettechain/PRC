# PRC-721 Non-Fungible Token Standard
## Simple Summary
A standard interface for non-fungible tokens, also known as deeds.

## Abstract
The following standard is the implementation of a standard API for NFTs. This standard provides basic functionality to track and transfer NFTs.

We considered use cases of NFTs being owned and transacted by individuals as well as consignment to third party brokers/wallets/auctioneers (“operators”). NFTs can represent ownership over digital or physical assets. We considered a diverse universe of assets, and we know you will dream up many more:

Physical property — houses, unique artwork
Virtual collectables — unique pictures of kittens, collectable cards
“Negative value” assets — loans, burdens and other responsibilities
In general, all houses are distinct and no two kittens are alike. NFTs are distinguishable and you must track the ownership of each one separately.

## Motivation
A standard interface allows wallet/broker/auction applications to work with any NFT on Pallte.

Differences between this standard and PRC-20 are examined below.

## Specification
The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

### NFT manager Events

#### Deploy
 This emits when any NFT has been deployed
```
event Deploy(address _owner, address _nftAddress);
```

### NFT Manager Interface

#### Deploy
Function to deploy and init an nft token.
```
function deploy(string _name, string _symbol) returns (uint256);
```

### Events

#### Transfer
This emits when ownership of any NFT changes by any mechanism. This event emits when NFTs are created (`from` == 0) and destroyed (`to` == 0). 
```
event Transfer(address _from, address _to, uint256 _tokenId);
```

#### Approval
This emits when the approved address for an NFT is changed or reaffirmed. 
```
event Approval(address _owner, address _approved, uint256 _tokenId);
```

#### ApprovalForAll
This emits when an operator is enabled or disabled for an owner. The operator can manage all NFTs of the owner.
```
event ApprovalForAll(address _owner, address _operator, bool _approved);
```

### Interface

#### supportsInterface

Query if a contract implements an interface.

/// @param interfaceID The interface identifier,	

IDENTIFIER_ERC165            = ("01ffc9a7") // ERC165

IDENTIFIER_ERC721            = ("80ac58cd") // ERC721

IDENTIFIER_ERC721_ENUMERABLE = ("780e9d63") // ERC721Enumerable

IDENTIFIER_ERC721_METADATA   = ("5b5e139f") // ERC721Metadata

/// @return `true` if the contract implements `interfaceID` and `interfaceID` is not 0xffffffff, `false` otherwise
```
function supportsInterface(bytes4 interfaceID) returns (bool);
```
	
#### mint

Mints a new NFT.

/// @param _to The address that will own the minted NFT.

/// @param _tokenId of the NFT to be minted by the msg.sender.

```
function mint(common.Address _to, uint256 _tokenId);
```

#### burn
Burns a NFT. Also, note that this burn implementation allows the minter to re-mint a burned NFT.

/// @param _tokenId ID of the NFT to be burned.

```
function burn(uint256 _tokenId);
```

#### balanceOf
Count all NFTs assigned to an owner. NFTs assigned to the zero address are considered invalid.

/// @param _owner An address for whom to query the balance

/// @return The number of NFTs owned by `_owner`, possibly zero

```
function balanceOf(address _owner) returns (uint256);
```

#### ownerOf
Find the owner of an NFT. NFTs assigned to zero address are considered invalid.

/// @param _tokenId The identifier for an NFT

/// @return The address of the owner of the NFT

```
function ownerOf(uint256 _tokenId) returns (address);
```

#### transferFrom
Transfer ownership of an NFT. 

Throws unless `msg.sender` is the current owner, an authorized operator, or the approved address for this NFT. 

Throws if `_from` is not the current owner. Throws if `_to` is the zero address. Throws if `_tokenId` is not a valid NFT.

/// @param _from The current owner of the NFT

/// @param _to The new owner

/// @param _tokenId The NFT to transfer

```
function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _tokenId);
```

#### approve
Change or reaffirm the approved address for an NFT. The zero address indicates there is no approved address.

Throws unless `msg.sender` is the current NFT owner, or an authorized operator of the current owner.

/// @param _approved The new approved NFT controller

/// @param _tokenId The NFT to approve
```
function approve(address _approved, uint256 _tokenId);
```

#### setApprovalForAll
Enable or disable approval for a third party ("operator") to manage all of `msg.sender`'s assets

Emits the ApprovalForAll event. The contract MUST allow multiple operators per owner.

/// @param _operator Address to add to the set of authorized operators

/// @param _approved True if the operator is approved, false to revoke approval

```
function setApprovalForAll(address _operator, bool _approved);
```

#### getApproved
 Get the approved address for a single NFT
 
Throws if `_tokenId` is not a valid NFT.

/// @param _tokenId The NFT to find the approved address for

/// @return The approved address for this NFT, or the zero address if there is none

```
function getApproved(uint256 _tokenId) returns (address);
```

#### isApprovedForAll
Query if an address is an authorized operator for another address

/// @param _owner The address that owns the NFTs

/// @param _operator The address that acts on behalf of the owner

/// @return True if `_operator` is an approved operator for `_owner`, false otherwise

```
function isApprovedForAll(address _owner, address _operator) returns (bool);
```

#### name
A descriptive name for a collection of NFTs in this contract.

```
function name() returns (string _name);
```

#### symbol
An abbreviated name for NFTs in this contract.

```
function symbol() returns (string _symbol);
```
	
#### owner
Returns the owner of this NFT contract.

@return _owner Representing the owner of contract.

```
function owner() returns (common.Address _owner);
```

#### tokenURI
A distinct Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for a given asset.

Throws if `_tokenId` is not a valid NFT.

```
function tokenURI(uint256 _tokenId) returns (string);
```
	
#### setTokenUri
Set a distinct URIfor a given NFT.

/// @param _tokenId Id for which we want URI.

/// @param _uri String representing the URI.

```
function setTokenUri(uint256 _tokenId, string _uri);
```

#### totalSupply
Count NFTs tracked by this contract

/// @return A count of valid NFTs tracked by this contract, where each one of them has an assigned and queryable owner not equal to the zero address.

```
function totalSupply() returns (uint256);
```

#### tokenByIndex
Enumerate valid NFTs.

Throws if `_index` >= `totalSupply()`.

/// @param _index A counter less than `totalSupply()`

/// @return The token identifier for the `_index`th NFT, (sort order not specified)

```
function tokenByIndex(uint256 _index) returns (uint256);
```

#### tokenOfOwnerByIndex
Enumerate NFTs assigned to an owner.

Throws if `_index` >= `balanceOf(_owner)` or if `_owner` is the zero address, representing invalid NFTs.

/// @param _owner An address where we are interested in NFTs owned by them

/// @param _index A counter less than `balanceOf(_owner)`

/// @return The token identifier for the `_index`th NFT assigned to `_owner`,(sort order not specified)

```
function tokenOfOwnerByIndex(address _owner, uint256 _index) returns (uint256);
```
